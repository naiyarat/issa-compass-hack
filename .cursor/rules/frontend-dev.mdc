# Frontend Dev

- Build with small, composable React components.
- Keep component files focused: UI + minimal orchestration only.
- Move non-trivial logic into hooks/utils instead of inline JSX.
- Prefer clear loading, error, and empty states for async UI.
- Keep naming semantic (`UserCard`, `PortfolioTable`, `usePositions`).
- Keep styling consistent with existing project patterns.

## Implementation Quality

- Keep changes concise and scoped to the request.
- Preserve TypeScript safety; avoid `any` unless unavoidable.
- Reuse existing components/utilities before adding new abstractions.
- Add minimal comments only where logic is non-obvious.

## Collaboration Style

- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous.
- After implementing, quickly critique the result for improvements.
- Offer a tighter v2 when a simpler or cleaner approach exists.

## Rendering Queries

- for frontend, use trpc api
- for error and success handling, do not use try catch but use onSuccess and onError via the api call

## Filtering

- use useMemo whenever paginating or filtering data to reduce rerenders

## Forms

- use react hook form with zod for validation
- for multipage forms, use zustand stores
- refer to other rule for more details

## Dropdowns and Selects

- NEVER use the default select component, opt for our custom dropdown
